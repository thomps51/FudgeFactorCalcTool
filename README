This program is used for calculating Fudge Factors, which are shifts for simulated Monte Carlo 
data variable distributions to better match actual data.  Fudge Factors are a bit of a hack, 
but they are the best thing we can do, short of 100% perfect detector modeling.


This program will take an NTUPLE with photons, bin the variables into eta and et, 
and then calculate the fudge factors with errors.




PUT YOUR INPUT FILES IN Config.C!!!!!
Fill out INPUT FILES in Config.C, and set the variables for running.

INPUT: NTUPLES from egammaAODtoNtupleDumper:
svn+ssh://svn.cern.ch/reps/atlasperf/CombPerf/EGamma/PhotonID/egammaAODtoNtupleDumper/
run over these files using the following commands:


SIMPLE USAGE FOR PHOTON FUDGE FACTORS:
# EDIT CONFIG AND ADD YOUR FILES TO INPUT 1
source setup.sh          # sets up root, output directories
make                     # makes the executables
./getSkimFromNTUP        # takes the input NTUP and makes Skimmed, Cut, Conv/Unconv samples
./getBinnedHistsFromSkim # takes skim file and bins in et/eta   |\
./getPDFsFromBinnedHists # makes PDFs from the binned files     | can do all three of these with ./getFFsFromSkim
./getFFsFromPDFs         # makes FFs from the PDFs              |/

The default output folder (can be changed in Config.C) is output/ , which has
the following folders by default:
skimmedNtups/  - contains the output of getSkimFromNTUP, which is also used as input to getBinnedHistsFromSkim.
  Contains skimmed ntups for data/mc conv/unconv.
hists/         - contains the output of getBinnedHistsFromSkim, which is also used as input to getPDFsFromBinnedHists.
  Contains binned histograms (in Et & Eta) for each of the skimmedNtups.
pdfs/          - contains the output of getPDFsFromBinnedHists, which is also used as input to getFFsFromPDFs
  Contains pdfs for all of the variables specified in Config.C
FudgeFactors/  - contains the output of getFFsFromPDFs.  This includes the following files:
  FudgeFactors_* .py and .C : the calculated fudge factor values, in the form variable[etBin][etaBin]
  ChiSqErrors*   .py and .C : the statistical error in the fudge factor values
  FF_tool_input*            : the input for the soon-to-be announced tool to replace FudgeMCTool for fudge factors
  outFile_FF*               : root file with plots of the chi-sq shifts and plots showing the effect of the shifts
