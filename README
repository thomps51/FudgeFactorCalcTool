This program will take the output from pskim, bin the variables into eta and et, 
and then calculate the fudge factors with errors.

PUT YOUR INPUT FILES IN Config.C!!!!!

You need to put the source files in the main.C file
Configuration options are in Config.C

Run like:
source setup.sh   # mainly to use root libs and c++11
make              # make sure it is compiled
./getFFsFromPskim # run the command
